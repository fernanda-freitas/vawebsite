* **ESlint:** ESlint was employed to ensure consistent code quality and adherence to coding standards throughout the development process;

* **Tailwind:**  Tailwind CSS was used to leverage the set of pre-built utility classes, enabling a highly customizable and responsive user interface;

* **Framer motion:** The Framer Motion library was implemented to create smooth animations and seamless transitions, enhancing the overall user experience;
